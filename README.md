## Overview

Facial recognition is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame. This project uses the KNN algorithm to perform facial recognition.

## Features

- Recognize faces from images
- Recognize faces from live video feed
- Easy to use and extend

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamzaabid016/Facial-recognition-using-knn.git
cd Facial-recognition-using-knn
```

### Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Live Stream Facial Recognition

To run the live stream facial recognition, execute the following command:

```bash
python checkin_new.py
```

### Training on Custom Dataset

To train the model on your custom dataset, run the following command:
```bash
python test_multipling.py
```
